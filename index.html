  <P>ABOUT ME</P>
         <p>My name is Luciauna (Luci) Heaton, and I am 9 years old.
             I have been dancing for almost my whole life (6 years to be exact)! My mom
             took me to see the production of Thriller by Odyssey Dance Company here in
             my home state of Utah, when I was the age of 3. That was the day I knew I wanted
             to be a dancer!
               My mom then enrolled me into rec classes at Elite Academy, to see if I enjoyed
               dancing and being on stage. I didn't just enjoy it; I LOVED it, and knew I wanted
               learn more about dancing. My coaches encouraged me to try-out for a Competition Team
               the following year, and so thats what I did. I was so excited to find out that I made the
               team, and I have been dancing Competition ever since.
 
           Dance has given me so many wonderful things. I made the very best friends here, who became
           my dance sisters; they became a part of my family. Dance has given me strength and confidence.
           There is nothing I love more than being at my studio with my dance sisters or performing on stage!
